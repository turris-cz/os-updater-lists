-- Contracted routers have in boot environment set contract variable that is used
-- in boot arguments. This variable should be preserved but due to bug in rescue
-- could have been corrupted on factory reset. Those fixes should recover it and
-- update the rescue system so it wouldn't get corrupted again.
-- We request reboot as contract is applied only after reboot.
